This is a [`ugly to-do app`](https://ugly-2-dont-app.pages.dev/) as a Next.js pwa project.

If install button didn't  pop up automatically you can just go to your browser's options menu and install it there.
Reminder still doesn't work, i'll add push notification for it later.
Previous version was using Redux coupled with LocalStorage and it was painfully slow so i replaced the whole thing with Dexie.
Although i've desgined it for mobile, some components aren't really for mobile so it may feel out of place.
Previously i made it using page router but now it's using app router and the codebase is now way more readable.
This app is made as a step to make something else, bigger and more ambitious so go easy on it.

Some apparently vital message on behalf of real content goes here to fill the void:

## Manage & categorize your projects & tasks

Sugarcoat things you hate to be assured you get your postponed tasks done eventually.
A simple, straightforward app that steps on your nerves so you get things done.

## Put everything where it truly belongs

Simply categorize tasks, projects and even other categories! This way you know which way to go to avoid them.

## Talk the talk... Walk the walk

Keep your procrastination skills in check with "Projects" where stuck projects and unchecked tasks are monitored and reported.

## Make Progress, step by step

Everything comes down to corporate-size tasks, where through suffering, maybe a few things happen.
